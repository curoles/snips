<h1>SPD - Single Point Documentation</h1>

<%SPD='<abbr title="Single Point Documentation">SPD</abbr>'%>

<p>
<%=SPD%> is an example and template for keeping all relevant to
typical SW project documentation in one place.
<%=SPD%> uses human readable text formats that can be rendered in Web browser.

<h2>Problem statement</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>There are many sources of information important to a project
      that usually get scattered all over IT-resources
      and not connected to each other:
      <ul>
        <li>Source code</li>
        <li>Source code and API manual or autogenerated documentation</li>
        <li>Wiki pages</li>
        <li>Presentation and training slides</li>
        <li>Bug tracking system</li>
        <li>Blogs and notes</li>
        <li>Dictionary of project specific terms and acronyms</li>
        <li>Technical discussions inside email threads</li>
        <li>Code review systems</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can't 'grep' all the sources at once, you have to search
      for the keyword inside each source separately.
  </li>
  <li>You can't easily search inside binary files.
  </li>
  <li>Lack of uniform way to reference documents.
      Some files on a File Server,
      some on local Web servers. 
  </li>
  <li>Information can easily get lost when a person leaves
      and her account is deleted by IT.
      Examples: e-mails.
  </li>

</ol>
</p>

<h2>SPD solution</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Keep all information in one Git repo.
      Update all related files at once.
  </li>
  <li>Use text formats only, Markdown is highly recommended.
      CLI "grep" should be able to find a keyword in any file.
      Fancy PowerPoint slides are usually waste of time anyway.
  </li>
  <li>Everything must be rendeable to HTML and displayed
      in local host web browser.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>SPD implementation</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Web pages are statically generated with Middleman.
  </li>
  <li>
  </li>
  <li>
  </li>
</ol>
