# Install common javascripts to use SPDoc offline

Plan:

- inside javascripts directory make sub-directory
  called third_party and add it to the .gitignore;
- with wget or curl download javascripts, since each
  file will be `make` target downloading will happen
  only one time;
- change the link to use local version of JS files;
- do the same for CSS files, stylesheets directory.
