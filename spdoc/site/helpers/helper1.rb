# An easy way is to put your helpers in the helpers directory
# and name them after their module (i.e., CustomHelpers lives in helpers/custom_helpers.rb).
# Then, Middleman will automatically load them and register them as helpers.

module Helper1
  def some_method
    # ...do something here...
  end
