                <p>Like the <a href="/sticky-footer/">original CSS Sticky Footer</a>, this <strong>HTML5 Sticky Footer</strong> works

                Hypogeum or hypogaeum (plural hypogea) literally means "underground", from Greek hypo (under) and gaia
                (mother earth or goddess of earth).It usually refers to an underground temple or tomb.

                There was a series of underground tunnels under the Colosseum where slaves and animals were kept ready
                to fight for the gladiatorial games. The animals and slaves would be let up through trapdoors under
                the sand-covered arena at any time during a fight.
